# Upwork MCP Server

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Upwork via browser automation. Enables Claude Code to search jobs, manage proposals, messages, and contracts on Upwork.

## Features

- **Job Search**: Search and filter Upwork jobs by keywords, budget, experience level, etc.
- **Job Details**: Get comprehensive information about specific job postings
- **Profile**: View your freelancer profile, connects balance, and stats
- **Proposals**: View, submit, and withdraw proposals
- **Messages**: Read and send messages in Upwork inbox
- **Contracts**: View active and past contracts, work diary entries

## How It Works

This MCP uses **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** to connect to your real Chrome browser. This approach:
- Bypasses Cloudflare's "automated test software" detection
- Uses your real browser profile with history and cookies
- Requires Chrome to be running with debug port enabled

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Google Chrome browser

### Install from source

```bash
cd upwork-mcp
uv sync
```

## Authentication

The server connects to Chrome via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol).

### First-time setup

```bash
# Start login flow - opens Chrome with debug port
uv run upwork-mcp --login
```

This will:
1. Start Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
2. Navigate to Upwork login page
3. Wait for you to complete login (click Cloudflare checkbox, enter credentials)
4. Save session to `~/.upwork-mcp/chrome-profile/`

### Check session status

```bash
uv run upwork-mcp --check
```

### Clear session

```bash
uv run upwork-mcp --logout
```

## Usage

### With Claude Code (local development)

Add to your MCP settings (`~/.config/claude-code/settings.json` or workspace settings):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "upwork": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/upwork-mcp", "run", "upwork-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Running tests

```bash
uv run python scripts/test_all.py
```

## Session Storage

Session data is stored in `~/.upwork-mcp/profile/`. This includes browser cookies and local storage that persist your Upwork login.

## Troubleshooting

### Session expired

```bash
# Re-authenticate
uvx upwork-mcp --login
```

### CAPTCHA or Cloudflare challenge

Run with visible browser to solve manually:

```bash
uvx upwork-mcp --no-headless
```

### Browser not found

```bash
# Install Chromium for Patchright
uvx patchright install chromium
```

## Responsible use

Personal project, not affiliated with Upwork. It automates a browser against **your own** account and is intended to run with a human in the loop — sensitive actions (submitting proposals, sending messages) spend Connects and contact real clients, so keep them behind explicit approval and reasonable rate limits. Review and follow Upwork's Terms of Service before using it. The local bid tracker exists specifically to avoid duplicate applications.
